For example, 2 is written as AA in Alien numeral, just two ones added together. 

12 is written as ZAA, which is simply Z +
AA. 


The number 27 is written as ZZBAA, which is ZZ + B + AA.


Alien numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. 
Example:

ZZBAA = 27
RDCLA = 1601




However, the numeral for four is not AAAA.

Instead, the number four is written as AB. 
AAAA != 4
AB = 4


Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. 

AB =! 6
AB = 4

The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as AZ. 

AZ = 9
AZ != 11



- There are six instances where subtraction is used:
- A can be placed before B (5) and Z (10) to make 4 and 9.
- Z can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
- C can be placed before D (500) and R (1000) to make 400 and 900. Given an Alien numeral, convert it to an integer.

Here are examples:

Example 1:
Input: s = "AAA"
Output: 3
Explanation: AAA = 3.


Example 2:
Input: s = "LBAAA"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, B= 5, AAA = 3.



Example 3:
Input: s = "RCRZCAB"
Output: 1994
Explanation: R = 1000, CR = 900, ZC = 90 and AB = 4.
